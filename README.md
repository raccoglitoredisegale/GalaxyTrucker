## 🚀 Implemented Functionalities

This project targets the **22/30 grade requirements**, implementing **Complete Rules**, **TUI**, and **1 Advanced Functionality**.

| Functionality | Status | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Rules** | 🟢 | **Complete Rules** (Standard flight, Level II) |
| **Interface** | 🟢 | **TUI** (Text User Interface) |
| **Network** | 🟢 | **Socket** Implementation |
| **Advanced Feature** | 🟢 | **Multiple Lobbies** (Server handles concurrent matches) |
| **Advanced Feature** | 🟢 | Persistence |
| **Advanced Feature** | 🔴 | Disconnection Resilience |
| **GUI** | 🔴 | Graphical User Interface |

### 📋 Key Features
- **MVC Pattern:** The architecture strictly follows the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Multiple Lobbies:** The server supports multiple simultaneous games.
- **Test Coverage:** **78%** line coverage on the Model.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- **Java SE 17** (or higher).
- **Maven** (only if building from source).

---

### Option A: Run from JAR (Deliverables)

Use this method if you are running the pre-compiled files located in the `/deliverables/final/jar` folder.

**1. Launching the Server**
Open your terminal in the JAR directory and run:

```bash
java -jar Server.jar
## 📝 How to Use

This section contains all instructions about how to run this project.

**From Intellij IDEA (Maven required)**

1. Open Terminal on project directory (`C:\[dir]\[project_folder]\`)
2. Run `mvn clean`
3. Run `mvn package`
4. Go to directory `C:\[dir]\[project_folder]\deliverables\JAR`
5. Launch Server: `java -jar Server.jar` (Server port = 54321 and ip from ipconfig on CMD of the server)
6. Launch CLI: `java -jar Client.jar` (ip and port will ask after running the program)

If you change the code, you'll have to repeat all the steps over again.

**From Repo clone**

1. Download Server, CLI jar files from `/deliverables/final/jar` folder
2. Open Windows PowerShell on project directory
3. Type `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8`
4. Type `chcp 65001` 
5. You must run line `4)` and `5)` only for Client
6. Launch Server: `java -jar Server.jar` (Server port = 54321 and ip from ipconfig on CMD of the server)
7. Launch CLI: `java -jar Client.jar` (ip and port will ask after running the program)

## Test coverage
 - 78% on model
